    <h1>The about</h1>
    <p>The story and motivation</p>
    <p>
      All starts with electric guitar and simple chane of pickups... some youtube videos and boom
      at instance you want more "advance" wiring. But how one can do it? You just search for schemes...
    </p>
    <p>
      The more you search, the more you realize, that you can make more with various wirings.
      But the problem is that there are a lot of schemes with the same functionality but with different
      schematics, as shitty image, locked over forum or private social network group, or paywall.
    </p>
      <p>
        So I was thinking, well, f**k them. I can design my wiring diagrams. Oh how I was wrong, looks
        good on the paper, but reality do not work. My knowledge of electric circuit design is very
        little and I do not want to spend time to learn it.
        I know the basic I need and I want to just do guitar wiring and play.
      </p>
    <p>
      I'm mainly programmer, so an idea sparks in my head. Why
      on the hell I was trying soldering this (frequently not working as it should) when I can make editor with circuit
      check? Design, check and solder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why not to add "real world" parts, schemes database and make it public?
    </p>
    <p>
      p.s. Existing editors? I look on those... Do you see one as web app with circiut check and "real"
      components form?
    </p>
    <p>
      p.p.s.
      It sounds a little offensive, so I beg your pardon. I get a little irritated when I think about this history...
